<h1>CIS 4930/6930, Programming Assignment 2</h1>

<h2>Heap overflow attack</h2>

Due: Thursday Oct 6 11:59pm. <br>

<hr>


<h3> Description </h3>
In this assignment you will have an opportunity to write an exploit for a heap
overflow vulnerability. You will use the <b>Redhat 8.0</b> VM image that was given to you.

<h3> Task (10 pts) </h3>
Find a heap overflow vulnerability in the source code <b>getscore_heap.c</b> which uses heap
instead of stack buffers. Write an exploit for the vulnerability that gives you a shell on the local 
system. You may want to first try the simple <b>heap.c</b> program we showed in the class. The
exploit generator for this program is <b>heap_exploit.c</b>.

<p><b>Hints:</b> 

<ul>
<li>
You will need to first read the source code of the program to understand how the malloc/free functions are called.
</li>
<li>
You will likely need to utilize both input parameters to make a working exploit.
</li>
<li>
malloc/free behaves differently depending on the size of the requested buffers. You want to be careful in choosing the right
size. You may want to make the size similar to the one in the simple heap.c program.
</li>
</ul>

For this assignment, you shall submit the following:

<ol>
  <li> (4 pts) A log documenting your process of developing the exploit and the
thinking behind the conclusions you draw when observing the program's
behaviors, so that someone else who has not done it can follow the
document to develop the same exploit as well; </li>

  <li> (6 pts) Source code of the exploit generator, and what we need to type in to compile/run
    your program.
  </li>
</ol>

Put everything in a single compressed file and submit it on CANVAS.
Even if you cannot finish a task, please still submit the log and 
partially-working program so that we can know your progress.
